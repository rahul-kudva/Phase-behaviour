This project uses the perf tool of linux to analyse the phase behaviour of three applications (gcc,apt,python program).Perf is a profiler tool for Linux 2.6+ based systems that abstracts away CPU hardware differences in Linux performance measurements and presents a simple commandline interface. We have made use of the map-reduce program of hadoop to find the number of times the cosine similarity of adjacent phases crosses the given threshold.
We have also clustered the points into similar clusters and found their cluster centers.
We have used gnuplot to plot graphs of the number of phases.
